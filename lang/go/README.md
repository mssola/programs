# Go programming language

Examples that helped me understand Go. They're listed as follows.

## Concurrency

* fib.go: simple generator pattern.
* timeout.go: Alice and Bob talk to each other through channels. A timeout will
  interrupt them.
* fan_in.go: basically the same as the timeout but the Alice and Bob channels
  joined into the same channel.
